# Demand-Forecasting-for-time-series-forecasting
To train a time-series forecasting model to predict the demand of various products across various stores using historical data. Run inference to forecast demand for all the products across all of the stores.
General steps to train a time-series forecasting model in this project:

Data Preparation.

Feature engineering.

Train-Test split.

Model Selection.

Model Training.

           *   Time-series prediction sequence modeling
           *   CNN-LSTM
Model Evaluation.

Inference and Forecasting.

Visualization and Interpretation.
